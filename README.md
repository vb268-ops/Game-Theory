# Game Theory

This repository has work done on Game Theory in different areas of application:

1. Imitation Learning (IL):
  A program with a generator and discrimator playing a game to devise a policy that imitates single expert trajectory.

2. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN):
  A GAN is created by playing a game between the generator and discrimininator. The goal is to be able to generate (x, y) pairs for a given input noise (here, a scalar     value). 
  
  This process still requires an upsampling capability using a decoder. (Currently not added to program)
